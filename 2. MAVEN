MAVEN : its a build tool.
build means adding libs, dependencies to our code and running them.
maven is build on java platform (1.8.0)
maven is introduced by apache software foundations in 2004.
it is free and opensource

MAIN REQ:
1. SOURCE CODE: The code used to develope application.
2. POM.XML: it will have libs, dependencies, plugins of code.
4. PLUGIN: A small software which automates our manual work.
4. JAVA-1.8.0: maven built & supports java (1.8.0)

POM: PROJECT OBJECT MODE / XML=EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGAUGE

compile + test + artifacts

raw: .java -- > compile -- > .class
.class = executable files
unit test: testing each feature of app individually
artifact: final product (.jar, .war, .ear)


.JAR: JAVA ARCHIVE : GROUP OF .CLASS FILES : BACKEND
.WAR: WEB ARCHIVE  : HTML, CSS , JS + .JAR : FRONTEND + BACKEND
.EAR: ENTERPRISE ARCHIVE: WAR + JAR


SETUP:
S-1: GET SOURCE CODE
yum install git java-1.8.0-openjdk maven tree -y
git clone https://github.com/devopsbyraham/jenkins-java-project.git

S-2: MAVEN LIFECYCLE

GOAL : its a command used to perform a task.

mvn compile	: compile the source code
mvn test 	: test the code
mvn package	: to create jar file (current folder)
mvn install	: to create jar file (.m2 folder)
mvn deploy	: to create war file

mvn clean packge : compile + test + Artifact (jar + war)


MAVEN VS ANT:
1. MAVEN HAS LIFE CYCLE BUT AND DONEST 
2. MAVEN USES PLUGINS BUT ANT USE SCRIPTS
3. PLUING IS REUSABLE BUT SCRIPTS CANT BE REUSABLE
4. MAVEN IS DECLARATIVE BUT ANT IS PROCEDURAL
